# Vehicle Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator – version 2

## 📌 Overview
This is **version 2** of the Vehicle Total Cost of Ownership (TCO) Calculator, built as a **web-based application** using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. This is a web application with basic UI.  

While the **UI is functional rather than visually polished**, this version was primarily developed to **practice and improve frontend development skills**. It implements the same underlying mathematical model from version 1 but allows users to input vehicle data and immediately see the calculated total costs in a web interface.

The app demonstrates how algebraic cost models can be transformed from a **console-based tool into an interactive web application**.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of version 2
- Translate the console-based TCO calculator (version 1) into a **web interface**
- Provide **interactive input** for multiple vehicle parameters
- Display **immediate calculation results** for Total Cost of Ownership and residual values
- Practice **frontend development skills** including HTML forms, DOM manipulation, and basic styling

This version focuses on **functionality and learning**, rather than creating a visually attractive UI.

---

## 🧮 Cost Components Included
The web app calculates the same cost components as version 1:

- **Initial Purchase Cost**
- **Depreciation** (reducing balance method)
- **Maintenance Costs** (tyres, brake pads, fluids, etc.)
- **Operating Costs** (fuel consumption, insurance)
- **Service Costs** (periodic servicing, emissions testing)
- **Ancillary Costs** (car washing, miscellaneous expenses)
- **Residual Value** (estimated resale value after ownership period)

---

## ⚙️ Assumptions
- Fuel price remains constant over the ownership period
- All wear components are brand new at purchase
- Distance traveled is fixed (user-specified)
- Lease payments excluded during usage
- Vehicle is purchased for resale after the defined period
- Maximum ownership lifespan capped at 10 years

These assumptions are consistent with the original research model and ensure uniform comparison between vehicles.

## 🖥️ Features
- Web-based interface for data input and calculations
- Supports multiple vehicle comparisons
- Shows detailed cost breakdowns by category
- Functional and responsive (basic layout, usable on desktop and mobile)
- Built as a **learning project** to enhance frontend skills

---

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Improve **UI/UX design** for better aesthetics and user experience
- Add **charts/visualizations** for cost comparisons
- Allow **saving/loading vehicle data** for repeated analysis
- Implement **dynamic adjustment of economic factors** such as fuel price or depreciation rates

## 📚 Research Background
This web app builds on the **academic research** of vehicle total cost of ownership, applying a mathematical model to real-world economic decisions in Sri Lanka. It demonstrates how **complex financial modeling can be converted into an interactive tool**, making it more accessible to users.
